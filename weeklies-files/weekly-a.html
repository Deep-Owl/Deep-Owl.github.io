This week in Art 3001 I learned the fundamentals of HTML.
So far my resources are limited, but I am able to create a basic web page.
I began working on the materials outside of class by researching some artists who also use web art as a primary medium. 
Some of these artists came up as examples in class.

My favorite artists out of the ones I found were:<ul><li><a href="https://olafureliasson.net/uncertain">Olufar Eliasson</a></li><li><a href="https://www.newrafael.com/texts/">Rafael Rozendaal</a></li><li><a href="https://reas.com/">Casey Reas</a></li></ul>
After doing some light research and bookmarking the HTML reference provided by Mozilla, I began writing some HTML.
I was having a hard time figuring out what I wanted my first project to look and feel like.
In order to alleviate my creative block I just started writing a stream of conciousness using the preformatted tag.
I then tried to space out each line of text so that it would be very nicely formatted.
I also italicized every word that I made up just for fun.
After that I attempted to make a simple design by using the horizontal line tag.

The final product looks like this:

Note that there is a link that does not work for this blog page.
Next I decided that I liked the phrase "Quantum if" so I turned it into a page that is formatted the exact same, but each word is written in reverse:

I would like to continue playing with this style for my first project.
However, I am also thinking aboiut doing a choose your own adventure style page based around bizaare things that have happened in my life.
It will be challenging to make a website without using CSS styling, but I think by keeping it simple I should be able to come up with interesting ways to bend HTML to do what I want.

Only time will tell!
