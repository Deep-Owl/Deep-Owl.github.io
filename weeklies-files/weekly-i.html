        I have been working on getting my final project to come together. The home page has taken much more time than
        expected.<br><br>
        I seem to have thoroughly over-complicated things in my endeavor to have a customized web page. After struggling
        for many many hours, I finally came up with a solution!
        My customized buttons are made of svg files, as well as my foreground. The SVG's are mapped to the page by
        calculating their original location from the illustrator then converting it to a percentage which can be handed
        off to CSS.
        On dynamic displays the buttons appeared to float in a more extreme direction than they should have. The only
        way to solve this issue was to ensure that the display was constantly the same size.
        The problem with this is that when the size of the page is fixed, my foreground image doesn't cover the entire
        page on larger displays.<br><br>
        My solution to this was to create a 4 cell table, the first cell contains my primary homepage content at a fixed size. The other cells are black and stretch to the edges of the page.
        Now my homepage stays the same size, the buttons stay exactly where they should be, and the entire page appears to be covered.<br><br>

        After completing this, I set about incorporating all of my other content. I ended up using iFrames in order to embed my exercises into my website.<br>
        This seems to have worked out quite nicely. There are some loose ends with my website that I will have to tie up on my own time after the semester is over.<br>
        For now I will focus on completing the assignment's essential components<br><br>

        Eventually I would like to add my processing games into the web page. I forget how to export the files so I will have to look this up later<br>
