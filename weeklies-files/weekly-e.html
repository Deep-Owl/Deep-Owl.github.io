    <h1><span style="font-size:2em;">Weekly E</style></h1>
    <Body>
        For the past few weeks I have been thinking about how I will approach making my own website for this course.
         About 7 years ago I made a game in processing and I've always wanted to host it somewhere so I am excited at the prospect of allowing other people to play it.<br><br>
        Some other things I am considering for my website are UI elements such as scrolling parallel and navigation.<br>
        I have seen some really cool uses of parallax images and navigational styles  on other websites in the past, sadly I have been unable to find the version that inspired me. <br>
        Something that I have also been thinking about is making a website that is meant to be viewed on a mobile device. That's what most people do nowadays anyways so it makes sense.<br><br>
        One of the examples I could not find was a mobile web page that used the phones gyroscope to manipulate vector images in the background, I thought that this was extremely cool and
        I'd like to try to do something similar if it does not cause me to step out of bounds of what is feasible in the time frame allotted for this project.
        I have been doing research on some websites that have interesting layouts and navigational systems.<br><br>
        <ul> <span style="font-size:1.5em;">Examples:</span>
            <li><a href="https://www.strml.net/">Computer programming</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://fahru.me/home">Another good programming one</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://seb-graf.com/">Good UI</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://the-goonies.webflow.io/">Parallax Navigation (Goonies)</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.avenircreative.com/">Interesting UI</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://webflow.com/ix2">Interesting Navigation</a></li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        Some other elements I have been thinking of are colors. I have been sampling some of my favorite color pallets from my own artwork by using Adobe Color.<br><br>
        Pallets:<br><br>

        <span style="font-size:20px;">1 : </span> 
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#F288B9"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#35D0F2"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#F2CF63"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#F2A444"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#91D389"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:white"></div>
        <br><br>

        <span style="font-size:20px;">2 : </span> 
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#C8A3D9"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#05AFF2"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#04C4D9"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#F0F2F2"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#F2EB8D"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:black"></div>
        <br><br>

        <span style="font-size:20px;">3 : </span> 
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#05AFF2"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#04C4D9"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#F2CB05"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#F29F05"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#FACFE5"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:black"></div>
        <br><br>

        <span style="font-size:20px;">4 : </span> 
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#61DBE8"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#DC6CF0"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#FF950F"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#FFD00F"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#000000"></div>
        <div class="color-box" style="background-color:white"></div>
        <br><br>

        Many of these color pallets seem similar Sso I might end up brainstorming some more interesting color combinations.

        <br><br>
        We have also been learning how to create a navigational bar, I will eventually link all of these reflections together with one.
        <br>
        Other than that I have gotten more of a hang on specificity and how to manipulate pseudo-classes and use inline style.
        <br>
        Tomorrow I will begin drafting my wireframes for my website, I have a few ideas so far, some involve a window with text oe an image behind it that scrolls, while the rest of the page is stationary.
         This image might be of a moon and stars that transitions to the sun and makes it look like you are looking out the window of your house. I will have to think about how this fits within a narrative-theme for my page, but I may not use it at all.
