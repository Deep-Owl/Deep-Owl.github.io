    <h1><span style="font-size:2em;">Weekly G</style></h1>
    <Body>
        I am excited to learn about P5 and JavaScript. As it turns out, P5 is the web-based, spiritual successor to the Processing language and IDE,
        which is good news for me because I have learned to use Processing in the past. This week's assignment reminds me of the first week I learned Processing.<br>
        I remember the first thing that I drew using vector math was a shark! After that I learned how to create basic video games in Processing.<br><br>

        I'm really hoping that we get more experience learning javascript and doing basic animations, because those skills will provide me with the resources I need to <br>
        finish my own website project. I was hoping to use my website for my professional practice class, because we need to develope our own personal websites, .<br>
        but I ended up using Adobe Portfolio instead.<br>.<br>

        I will have a link to the website that I am making for this class on my adobe portfolio site. And I'm hoping that eventually I can use the website for this class as my primary website.<br><br>

        I think that for the first assignment I will try to create a mandala. I have not started the assignment yet, I will likely begin it tomorrow and wrap it up on tuesday night..<br>
        It is unfortunate that we are not allowed to use more advanced coding techniques on this first assignment, I have been coding a lot for the past 2 years and I am eager to use my skills!.<br>.<br>
