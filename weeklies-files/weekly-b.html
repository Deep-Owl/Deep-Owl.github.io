        I ended up making a simple website that displays some of my own work as well as a work that I am excited by. The work is an ink painting of a dragon by Kano Hogai and I saw it in a museum in Philadelphia a few years back.<br>

        I was able to embed a short video into my page as well, it was a lot more simple than I thought it would be.<br>

        I am hoping to learn more, so far html and CSS is very different from what I am used to with coding. The specificity of elements is somewhat confusing and seems vague.<br>

        I will continue trying to make word for this class that is able to be displayed on different sized screens. I was able to accomplish this to some degree in the first exercise.<br>
