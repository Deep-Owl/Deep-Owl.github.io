    <h1>Weekly C</h1>
    <body>
        This week we began to dive into CSS...
        <br><br>
        I am still a little hazy on everything we will be able to accomplish with CSS, 
        however I think that once I start finding examples of work that I like, I will be able 
        to emulate something interesting to the best of my ability.
        <br><br>
        I have been trying to practice writing HTML by taking notes in class in Visual Studio Code:
        <br><br>

        <div class = "code-box">
            <div>
                <ul>Notes:
                    <li>"!important" tag enshrines an element as the way it is supposed to be and should not change</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><ol>Specificity Hierarchy:
                        <li>Inline style</li>
                        <li> IDs</li>
                        <li>Classes, Psuedo Classes, attributes</li>
                        <li>Elements, pseudo-elements</li></ol></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><ul>Inheritance:
                        <li>Cascades values down with parent-child relationship</li>
                        <li>Text related properties are inherited: size, color, family</li>
                        <li>"inherit" keyword forces inheritence</li>
                        <li>"initial" keyword resets a property to its original value</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Border is space from border to element</li>
                    <li>Margin is the actual border around the content</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        For this week's project I am going to make 5 iterations of the poem "The Tyger", 
        written by William Blake in 1794. The poem is an existential work about questioning the existence 
        and intentions of God. The poem has a symmetrical motif that I plan to emphasize with CSS formatting. 
        The first time I heard of the poem was when I was reading "The Watchmen". There is chapter that is based on
        The symmetrical apsect of Blake's poem, once realized, the symmetry adds amn entirely new dimension to
        the graphic novel, and can be entirely overlooked if one is not paying attention. It was one of the most interesting
        moments of the entire graphic novel.
        <br><br>
        Here is the poem:
        <br><br>
        Tyger Tyger, burning bright,<br>
        In the forests of the night;<br>
        What immortal hand or eye,<br>
        Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br><br>
            
        In what distant deeps or skies.<br>
        Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
        On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
        What the hand, dare seize the fire?<br><br>
            
        And what shoulder, & what art,<br>
        Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
        And when thy heart began to beat.<br>
        What dread hand? & what dread feet?<br><br>
            
        What the hammer? what the chain,<br>
        In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
        What the anvil? what dread grasp.<br>
        Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<br><br>
            
        When the stars threw down their spears<br>
        And water'd heaven with their tears:<br>
        Did he smile his work to see?<br>
        Did he who made the Lamb make thee?<br><br>
            
        Tyger Tyger burning bright,<br>
        In the forests of the night:<br>
        What immortal hand or eye,<br>
        Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?<br><br>
