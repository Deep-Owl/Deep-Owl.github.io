        For the past few weeks, I have been getting my first project together and researching the best ways to implement my designs.<br>
        I have not run into major issues yet. I wanted to create  my own designs, and use them as elements for my page, so I have been using adobe Illustrator to create SVG files.<br>
        By creating vector images I will be able to allow my website to scale to different sizes while retaining image quality.<br>
        I am also making a large color map that will be layered underneath some transparent elements of my project.<br>
        The color map will be mapped to the cursor so that when the cursor moves, the map will move as well.<br>
        I will also use a scaling scroll speed so that the map moves more dynamically than the actual cursor. This will make my page feel more dynamic.<br>
        I am having a hard time balance all of my responsibilities but I will be spending the next 3 days focusing only on this project.<br><br>
        Wish me luck, I'll see you on the other side :)<br><br>
