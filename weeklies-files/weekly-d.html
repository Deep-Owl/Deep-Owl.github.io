    This week I learned more about CSS styling.<br>

    Something that I am really interested in is interface design, and I have often wondered how to make flexible designs. <br>
    I have wanted to be able to design something that looks different depending on what type of device the viewer is using, and has a certain level of interactivity<br>
    So when I started working on my poem project it was important to me to learn how to create an interface that looks different depending on how big the window is. My first step was learning how to make all the content scale to screen. <br>
    I created customized tables and used scaling properties such as...


        <div class = "code-box">
            <div>
                width: 100%; <br>
                width: 100vw; <br><br>

                height: 100%; <br>
                height: 100vh; <br><br>

                top: 50%; <br>
                left: 50%; <br>
                transform: translate(-50%, -50%); <br><br>

                display: flex;<br>   
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    I also learned how to use specific tools like importing text from google fonts<br>
    I have installed custom libraries that check my spelling and allow me to color my IDE windows so that I can tell which project I am looking at when I have multiple projects opened<br>
    My poem was about symmetry so I used the reflect-x property very liberally.<br>
    So far have I been really leaning into using the same tools repetitively but iterating and improving the style of the element each time<br>
    I have leaned heavily into styling my own tables, lists, and pre tags<br><br>
    Overall I am very proud of my work so far, in the future I would really like to learn how to make floating objects and make something that can be viewed on a cellular phone.<br>
    There is one design that really stuck out to me where there was a floating vector image behind a wall of text and it used the accelerometer built into the phone to float and rotate depending on how you moved the phone. <br>
