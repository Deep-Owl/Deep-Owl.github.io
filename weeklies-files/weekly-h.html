        Learning JavaScript wasn't too shabby for me, given my programming background. It's like I'm already speaking
        the language, and now I'm just adding a bit of flair to it. Rotations turned out to be surprisingly easy to
        implement, and the visual impact is like giving your webpage a cool makeover.<br><br>

        Now, let's talk about HTML formatting – the not-so-cool part. For someone used to the logic of programming
        languages, diving into HTML has been like navigating a maze blindfolded. It's not a walk in the park, and it's
        making me appreciate clean code even more.<br><br>

        To amp up my webpage, I decided to get artsy and designed my own elements using Adobe Illustrator. Picture this:
        unique visuals that scream 'me.' The tricky part? Making them look good on screens of all shapes and sizes.<br><br>

        So, I took a somewhat scientific approach and mapped each element to a percentage of the height and width of the
        original design. It's like ensuring your artwork fits perfectly in any frame – dynamic and always ready to<br><br>
        impress.

        In a nutshell, diving into JavaScript has been a mix of creativity and problem-solving. HTML formatting might be
        giving me a run for my money, but I'm determined to crack the code.
