          ><br /><br />
          Devin Powell is a multimedia artist and student based out of Columbus
          Ohio who embraces the challenge of growth and explores diverse mediums
          such as ceramics, sound, and robotics. He enjoys the problem solving
          aspect of writing software and interfacing with electronics and is
          currently focusing on improving his abilities with technology. He has
          been named on the Dean's list consecutively as an undergraduate at the
          Ohio State University and was recently hired as an assistant to
          emeritus faculty and artist Ken Rinaldo following a robotics
          internship.

          ><br /><br />
          &emsp;When I can’t find the words to describe my thoughts and
          feelings, and often turn to nonverbal forms of communication such as
          visualization and sound. The idea of expression is paramount to my
          work. While sometimes my projects are influenced by interests and
          aesthetics, I’ve found that my more conceptual work often revolves
          around themes rooted in the human experience – relationships, healing,
          empathy, memory, passion, esotericism and community. I'm drawn to the
          concept of facilitating individuals to encounter themselves and
          acknowledge the aspects of life that bubble beneath the surface. I
          have been exploring how to extract meaning from and manifest these
          concepts through abstraction, by demonstrating collective experiences,
          and through immersive environments. I also find satisfaction in
          revealing facets of myself that others can connect with or shedding
          light on aspects of others that often remain unexplored. It's about
          introducing us to ourselves, fostering a sense of visibility and
          presence within our ongoing life narrative.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp;Recently I have been thinking about how to express concepts
          through more technical means. One of my latest works was an exercise
          realized through microcontroller units and computer language. I
          created a dynamic, sound-reactive sculpture using microcontrollers, a
          microphone, 204 LEDs, custom 3D printed gears, lumber and a motor and
          various electronic components. The finished project is less conceptual
          than some of my other works but served as a necessary steppingstone on
          my journey in a new field of practice. As the project neared
          completion, I imagined the potential of populating a space with many
          of these interactive sculptures, inviting people to immerse themselves
          in work, which was originally about how we respond to the physical
          presence of others.
